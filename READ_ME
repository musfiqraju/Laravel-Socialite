This is the easiest way to login with any social platform like github/facebook/google... in Lararavel App

# AT first you have to authenticate using laravel 'php artisan ui vue/react --auth' command and create user table
# Then use this command 'composer require laravel/socialite'
# you have to register your laravel app  at any social platform at developer option to get slient_id and client_secret 
  use this link (https://github.com/settings/developers) to go to your github developer/register_app directory.
  note: you have to have a github account already. You can do the same using your google account also. I have done using Github. 
  If you dont use your github account then make changes where needed. Thats it.
# thats all, just copy-past all files at the right directory and Boom! you are done.
